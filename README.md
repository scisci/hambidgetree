# hambidgetree
A layout utility used for Daily Phi. Daily Phi posts spatially harmonic layouts daily. A spatially harmonic layout is one in which each division of the space is harmonically congruent with all of its siblings.

This work is heavily inspired by the work of John Hambidge in his seminal work "The Elements of Dynamic Symmetry." In fact, the algorithm used to generate the layouts uses a concept I've called a Hambidge Tree. A Hambidge Tree starts with a root representing a single ratio. For instance, we could start with a square, which has a ratio of 1:1 in 2 dimensions. The root can then be divided based on a set of harmonic ratios (for our project we used a set of ratios based on Phi, the golden ratio, which is what John Hambidge's theories proposed). One can then recursively divide the leaves of the Hambidge Tree to generate a vast number of layouts of infinite depth.

The inspiration for this project came from my loss of breath whilst viewing John Hambidge's pencil-drawn layouts using these ratios. They contain an indescribable power which much be classified under the classification: Magic.

Daily Phi was created by Dan Riley July 2017.
